### The Company 
LCA Bienes Raices is a company in the real estate sector that is located in Tecate B.C, its main activity is the purchase / sale of real estate using social networks, posters and its website as sales channels.

**The website** should have improvements in the interface and user experience, improving the delivery and presentation of properties in order to stand out from the competition, increase interactions, attract potential customers and improve sales.

Thus, a system must also be created to help the company manage properties, clients and tickets, the creation of statistics is also sought to create effective advertising campaigns that are not only based on page views.


### The clients
The profile may vary depending on the type of property you are looking for, but in general we can say that our clients are.

**Customers**
* Age: 35 - 50 years
* Profession: Administrative services, management, production, business and finance.
* Education: University.
* Marital Status: Married

*Information obtained from Facebook Insights using similar audiences*

Their general fear is to feel that the company is manipulating or scamming you in some way, which is why it is very important to have clear information with images that generate trust on a page that is easy to use by people whose experience in using applications is mainly based on Facebook, Amazon, Ebay and Mercado libre.
