> Created at 3/30/2021

We will see how we carry out the design process of the project database, we'll use `MongoDB`, if you want to know the reasons, check out the [Why MongoDB?](#why-mongodb)

## Criteria on Data Modeling 
A big dilemma in NoSQL DB is deciding whether our documents should be` Referenced / Normalized` or `Embedded / Denormalized`. To establish whether it is Normalized or not, we will use the following criteria.


1. **Relationship Type** How two datasets are related to each other
2. **Data Access Patterns**. How often data is read and written. Read /write ratio.
3. **Data Closeness** How *much* the data is related, how we want to query.

|                       | Embedded / Denormalized                                                               | Referenced / Normalized                                       |
| -------------         |:-------------                                                                         | :-----|
| Relationship Type ‚ù§  | 1 : Few <br>  1 : Many                                                                | 1 : Many <br> 1 : Ton <br> Many : Many                               |
| Data Access Patterns  | Data is mostly **read** <br> Data does not change quickly <br> High read/write ratio  | Data is updated a lot <br> Low read/write ratio               |
| Data Closeness        | Datasets really belong together                                                       | We frequently need to query both <br> datasets on their own   |


## Phases 
| Phase                 | Target & Method                           |
| -------------         |:-------------                             |
| [Conceptual Design]() | Conceptual Data Model - UML               |
| **Logical Design**    | Key-Value , Document, ColumFamily , Graph |
| **Physical Design**   | Document - MongoDB                        |

### Conceptual Design 

#### Entities 
The entities are shown in a very general way below, click on each one to go a little deeper üê§

1. **Admin.** Person who manages the properties, clients and promissory notes. In addition to controlling what is displayed on the page
2. **Property.** Property that is being offered. Many properties can be purchased by many clients. *This is a 1:Few Relationship*
3. **Customer.** Person who buys or sell one or many properties. Many Customers can buy/sell various properties. *This is a 1:Few relationship*
4. **Promissory.** Legal Document that is generated when a purchase is made **in payments**

Bueno, hay que ser mas especificos, veamos el siguiente diagrama UML para tener una idea mas clara de lo que necesitamos. 

### Logical Design 

#### Property Entity



### Physical Design 

## Why MongoDB?
**We use MongoDB mainly for performance**, we think using Mongo for this project is ideal for the following reasons

* **Semi-structured data**. Being properties, the structure of each type can vary, so a dynamic scheme can be a good option.
* **Limited query patterns**. Property searches don't usually have as many variables, so the queries are straightforward.
* **Without complex queries**. As mentioned in the previous point, the queries for the properties are not complex, using a non-SQL database will help to increase the performance of the queries even more.
* **Agile development.** MongoDB is suitable for fast iterative development, and its presentation in JSON format allows the rest of the work team to cooperate.
