## System documentation *What's n' here?* <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
  Represents documents that describe the system itself and its parts. Here are the main recommendations points to include in the product requirement document:

## Requirements document   <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
A product requirement document or PRD provides information about system functionality. Generally, requirements are the statements of what a system should do. It contains business rules, user stories, use cases, etc. This document should be clear and shouldn’t be an extensive and solid wall of text

* **Roles and responsibilities.** Start your document with the information about project participants including a product owner, team members, and stakeholders. These details will clarify responsibilities and communicate the target release goals for each of the team members.

* **Team goals and business objective.** Define the most important goals in a short point form.

* **Background and strategic fit**. Provide a brief explanation of the strategic aim of your actions. Why are you building the product? How do your actions affect product development and align with the company’s goals?
* **Assumptions.** Create a list of technical or business assumptions that the team might have.

* **User Stories.** List or link user stories that are required for the project. A user story is a document written from the point of view of a person using your software product. The user story is a short description of customer actions and results they want to achieve.

* **Acceptance criteria.** Those are the conditions that indicate a user story is completed. The main purpose of acceptance criteria is to define a satisfactory result for a usage scenario from the end-user perspective. Check our dedicated article on acceptance criteria to learn more.
User interaction and design. Link the design explorations and wireframes to the page.

* **Questions.** As the team solves the problems along the project progression, they inevitably have many questions arising. A good practice is to record all these questions and track them.

* **Not doing.** List the things which you aren’t doing now but plan on doing soon. Such a list will help you organize your teamwork and prioritize features.

## User Story Mapping And Prototypes (UI/UX)   <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

User flow or user journey schemes help the team to map the steps a user should take through the whole product. The main task of a user flow scheme is to depict the possible steps a user may take, going from page to page.

## Software architecture <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The architecture design documentation is about how to build it. It has to describe in what way each product component will contribute to and meet the requirements, including solutions, strategies, and methods to achieve that. So, the software design document gives an overview of the product architecture, determines the full scope of work, and sets the milestones, thus, looping in all the team members involved and providing the overall guidance.

## Quality assurance documentation <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

> Anything in software development that takes ten minutes or less to perform is either trivial or is not worth doing in the first place. - James Whittaker

According to Google (2011, September 1) We will be based on the writing made by Wittaker, where he tells us that the 3 most important things to create a test plan are:

1. **Attributes** the adverbs and adjectives that describe the high level concepts testing is meant to ensure. Attributes such as fast, usable, secure, accessible and so forth.
2. **Components** the nouns that define the major code chunks that comprise the product. These are classes, module names and features of the application.
3. ** Capabilities ** the verbs that describe user actions and activities.

**What tests will we do?** We will do functionality, usability, system tests, unit tests and if there is time, integration tests.
