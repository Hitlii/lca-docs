# Process Documentation - What's in here? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Here will go all the documentation of the project process, it will be by sprints and should be written in English, also for the **working documents** we should include references in APA format, to make it easier, use ðŸ‘‰ [APA generator](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-citation-generator/)

### Drawings, estimates and schedules <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
 These documents are usually created before the project starts and may change as the product evolves.
 > We will use PlanItPoker and Google Sheets (We will only link).

### Reports and metrics <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Reports reflect how time and human resources were used during development. They can be generated on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

> We will use Trello (We will only link)


### Working Papers. <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
 These documents exist to record the ideas and thoughts of engineers during project implementation. Working documents generally contain information about an engineer's code, sketches, and ideas on how to solve technical problems. While they should not be the primary source of information, keeping track of them allows you to retrieve very specific details of the project if necessary.

> When there are doubts in each sprint about implementing something, this part should be tracked and the source should be cited.

### Standards. <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
 The standards section should include all coding and UX standards that the team adheres to throughout the progression of the project.

 
 [Code Conventions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp "Code Conventions")
 > We will establish the conventions that we will use in coding and file naming, as well as the UX design conventions.

*Most process documents are specific to the particular time or phase of the process. As a result, these documents become outdated and obsolete quickly. But they should still be maintained as part of development because they may prove useful for implementing similar tasks or maintenance in the future. In addition, process documentation helps make the entire development more transparent and easier to manage.*
